The early, middle, and late behavior have different appearences...
Early: I have no idea...this seems like the key one to reproduce
Middle: Blocks of color develop
	Go black from the edges (?)
Late: Blocks stabilize and slowly die out. Converges to all black except a white rectangle at coords:
	(4,5),(4,6) , (4,8),(5,8) , (7,5),(7,6) , (7,3),(6,3)
White behaves differently than the other colors
	Extends in lines towards the rectangle points
	(Probably) can go to any color but almost always goes to black
Mutates much slower than other Qs

	This implies that a pixel choses at random is very likely to stay the same color
Black can go to any color but it is more likely to go to White than anything else
	See *_fromBlack.png
	The least pronounced test of this was 50% to White and 50% to other
	This seems the result of other rules, not a rule unto itself
	Black -> White when White is traveling to rectangle points but...
	What circumstances can a black go to not White?
		Mostly seems the same as any other color but there are anomolies

		But the anomolies are only present in this one file...could be recording error. [Not an error, colors can "spontaneously" appear]
	In general it seems colors change to match the color of shared edges (Not true in beginning!!!) 
	The most common mutation, by a good amount, is a color mutating to Black
What are the conditions for going to Black?
	pixel + (sum of adj.)%10 [Nope]
	no common factor among adjacent pixels [Nope]
	pixel has no common factor with adjacent pixels [Nope, otherwise color blocks would never go black]
	if there are adjacent black -> go black [Nope]
	doesn't need to have an adjacent black [Yup]
	does black behave the same as every other color?
Can a pixel change to a color that it does not share an edge with?
	Yes, see Spontaneous_Mutations.txt
	Often times there was a diagonal pixel of the same color, but not always
	Keep track of steps, maybe these mutations occur only early and then the blocking behavior really takes hold [Nope, they can occur whenever]
Any color can change to any other color
When changing a pixel...
	Is a new color calculated based on the adjacent? adjacent and diagonal? both of these and the actual color of the pixel?
	What ever it is, the colors of adjacent pixels are more likely
	So what calculations can account for this increased likelyhood while allowing for any mutation to occur?
		Common factor [This wouldn't work, too many prime numbers]
	floor(avg of adj pixels) [Nope]
	Does the avg have any correlation? [Only slightly, I think it's a result of adjacent colors being more common]
Maybe examing the cases when a color changes to somethin not adjacent could help...
	Didn't get any ideas
Examing only when a color mutates to 3
Does white always extend in the direction of the rectangle?
	[Unclear] If by normal rules a pixel can go to white, results are inconclusive
	But it does seem that white displays distinct behavior, at least in the late stages, in creating the rectangle
Can a color block extend in any direction?
	[Yes], may imply that all adj pixels are taken into account when mutating
There is no (easily) observable correllation between certain numbers being adjacent and a new color besides the one already stated
