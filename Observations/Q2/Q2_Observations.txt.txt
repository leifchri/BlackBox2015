*Tests were run on 5 runs of 1x1000*
0Black cannot mutate
1Grey can go to anything
2Blue goes to 4Cyan, 6Red, 8Pink, or 0Black
3Purple can go to anything
4Cyan goes to 2Blue, 6Red, 8Pink, or 0Black
5Green only goes to Black
6Red goes to 2Blue, 4Cyan, 8Pink, or 0Black
7Orang goes to anything
8Pink goes to 2Blue, 4Cyan, 6Red, or 0Black
9White can go to anything
For all colors, 0Black seems the most likely mutation [Tenuous, shown in weak majority of tests]
Even numbers can go to any other even number
	Maybe there is a global level order of even number mutations [Nope]
	Is it pixel + 2*number? Where could this number come from?
Just looking at 2Blue -> 6Red
	Is it effected by the number of adj evens? [Nope]
	Sum of adj? [Nope] Product of adj? [Nope]
	The value of one particular adj or diagonal? [Doesn't seem like it, change has occured in every position excapt bottom right corner]
Just looking at 2Blue -> 4Cyan
Just looking at mutations from 2 surrounded by mostly zeros
	Identical 3x3 configurations can go to different values, implies that rule does not depend (entirely) on adj/diag [See fromBlue2WithBlacks]
Calculate probability of each mutation
	from 2Blue there doesn't seem to be any pattern except Black is, usually, the most frequent [see fromBlue2Prob]
Just looking at 2 surrounded by all zeros
	Maybe the area of Q2 has an effect [Nope, see from2BlueAll0*.txt]
	Related to sum of Q2 or number of nonzero elemenents? [Nope, ""]
2Blue -> ?
	When a pixel goes to 0 even number transition changes [Nope]
As time goes on the probability of a pixel going to Black increases [See Q2MutationList.txt]
Usually there is over 50% even numbers for last ~10 pixels
	This makes sense since once a pixel goes to an even number it will stay even
Two frames where everything is 0 except one 2 and the 2 goes to different values [See TwoDifFramesWithDifOut]
	What's different between them? 
	The step is different [789 vs. 825]
	The previous change is dif [4  changed to  0 vs. 2  changed to  6]
So a mutation is not directly contigent on the current pixels of Q2
	Does it have to do with the other quadrants? [Nothing's jumping out, see 1stStepMutations.txt]
	"		      " the step #? [Probably not, same color in 1st step mutates to dif., see Q2MutationList.txt]
	" 		      " the pixels coordinates? [Nope, same starting pixel in same coord mutates dif, see MutationsPixel_1_0.txt]
	"                     " previous mutations?
		1st step: 2->4
		2nd step: 1->5, 1->5, 2->7, 3->5, 4->0, 
			  5->0, 6->0, 6->0, 6->4, 7->0, 
			  7->0, 7->1, 7->1, 7->2, 7->5,  
			  8->0, 9->6, 9->1, 4->2, 2->0, 
			  9->0, 9->2, 9->2, 9->6 
How many times can one pixel change?
	Seems pretty random, 0 to 6 times [See Q2MutationCount.txt]
